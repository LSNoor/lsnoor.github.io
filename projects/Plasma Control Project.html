    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>During my work at Dragonfly/Comet, I was part of a team aiming to tackle challenges related to the
        control of a plasma etching machine. The team included plasma scientists and ML research engineers
        and the work was conducted in San Jose, CA and Montréal, QC.</p>

      <p>We optimized the experimental control of constrained plasmas by combining reinforcement
          learning with uncertainty-driven active learning using committee and ensemble surrogate
          disagreement as the acquisition signal alongside Bayesian optimization.</p>

      <p>We also developed a physics-informed digital twin simulator to train and validate selections strategies.</p>

      <p>While details on this project are under NDA, feel free to contact me for details, I will do my
          best to answer your question.</p>

      <p><strong>Surrogate Modeling & Active Learning for Industrial Machine Control</strong></p>


      <p>
        Controlling and optimizing production processes is a fundamental challenge in modern industry,
        particularly in capital-intensive sectors such as microelectronics. This work addresses the development
        of a surrogate model—a neural network trained via supervised learning—to faithfully reproduce the behavior
        of a complex industrial machine ("Machine X") treated as a black box. Since operating the machine is costly
        and constrained, building a reliable simulator enables faster, parallelizable experimentation without physical
        access to the system.
      </p>

      <p>
        A key challenge lies in the scarcity of labeled data: Due to the extent of the input space, exhaustive
        grid-based exploration of the input space is infeasible, and random sampling fails to prioritize the most
        informative regions. To address this, we employ active learning through Query by Committee (QBC),
        a model-agnostic method that identifies high-uncertainty regions by measuring prediction disagreement
        among an ensemble of bootstrap-trained models. We propose and compare three QBC variants: (1) a standard
        pool-based approach, (2) a query synthesis approach using optimization to converge toward high-variance points,
        and (3) a Neural Adjoint QBC (NA-QBC) variant that introduces a learned variance estimator
        prior to optimization.
      </p>

      <p>
        Experiments conducted on benchmark functions in one and two dimensions show that all three variants
        yield performance equivalent to or slightly better than random sampling, with a notable ability
        to detect discontinuities and critical regions of the input space. The methods show particular promise
        during early iterations, and this theoretical advantage is expected to increase in higher-dimensional
        settings (>2), which remains to be validated. Additionally, the proposed solution supports automated input
        transmission to the real machine, eliminating manual adjustments and significantly accelerating the overall
        data acquisition process.
